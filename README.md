We are Team **Vote for Reboot** from _Google Developer Student Clubs Korea University, Seoul Campus_.


## **Project Intro**

Vote for Reboot is a service service that visualizes community issues and fosters active communication among members through voting. 
Our team utilized GCP's Cloud Run and Cloud SQL, along with Flutter to ensure a seamless, scalable, and secure experience for users. This enhances user engagement which is most important in the community service platform.


## **Problem Statement**

#### **Main Target**
Members of a community, such as apartment complexes, divided into users and administrators, are the main target of our challenge.

#### **Main Problem**
In communities, problems arise incessantly. It's impossible for administrators to identify and properly address all these issues. Furthermore, even if good suggestions come up, there have been cases where opinions were not properly conveyed, leading to incorrect modifications or rejection. We have noticed these two limitations.


## **UN Sustainable Development Goal & Targets**
![SDGs](https://github.com/RememberMe-2024-SolutionChallenge/RememVR-md/assets/123253883/33ce6474-8fd4-411b-be2e-c0ae2606d284)
Our solution aligns with SDG goals 11 and 17. By identifying and improving neglected spaces within urban and local communities, we aim to enhance their efficient utilization. Moreover, we facilitate community meetings and visualize experiences to foster collaboration among community members. Additionally, through activating partnerships between the public and civil sectors, we aim to establish effective civil societies, thereby establishing a sustainable management system for urban space improvement.
